# Shedding Pond

A communal web ritual for the Spring Festival/New Year. Users draw a snake, write what they wish to release, and watch it fade into a shared pond — anonymous and meaningful.

## Why I Built This

For Spring Festival 2026 (Year of the Fire Horse), I wanted to create something that felt less like a tech project and more like a shared experience, a digital pond where people could let go of something and watch it dissolve. I'm hoping people come out of using this feeling empowered for the new year especially with a anonymous community by their side.

## Technical Highlights

### Security (Production-Hardened)

This app is designed to be safely shared with a public audience.

- **Server-side mutations only** — The client-side Supabase key is read-only (`SELECT` via RLS). All inserts, updates, and deletes go through API routes using a service role key that never reaches the browser.
- **Deep input validation** — Drawing data is validated at the field level: hex color regex, finite coordinate ranges, stroke/point count limits, canvas dimension bounds. Messages are sanitized for control characters, zero-width characters, and bidirectional overrides.
- **Content moderation** — Profanity filtering via `leo-profanity` with a custom normalization layer that catches evasion tactics such as repeated characters at the end of innapropriate words.
- **Rate limiting** — Per-IP rate limiting (60 req/hour) backed by Supabase with SHA-256 hashed IPs. Fail-closed in production, fail-open in development.
- **Security headers** — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy configured in `next.config.js`.
- **Middleware** — Global request size limits (1MB) and HTTP method filtering on all API routes.
- **Community moderation** — Report button on each snake, backed by a `reports` table for manual review.

### Architecture

- **Client-server separation** — Two Supabase clients: a public anon client for reads, a server-only service role client for writes. The service role key is never bundled or exposed.
- **Ephemeral by design** — Snakes fade to 25% opacity over 8 seconds on the island (client-side calculation from `created_at`, no DB polling). The pond is a living, breathing thing.
- **Island capacity management** — When the pond fills (~25 snakes), the oldest are gracefully migrated to a permanent gallery. Position placement uses collision avoidance with configurable minimum distance.
- **Paginated gallery** — Gallery loads in pages via a dedicated API route with `Cache-Control` headers, preventing the page from choking on thousands of entries.

### Frontend

- **Canvas drawing engine** — Custom `<canvas>` implementation with DPI-aware rendering, multi-stroke support, and dual input handling (native touch events for mobile, pointer events for desktop).
- **Responsive pond** — SVG clip-path pond shape with a full decoration system (lily pads, lotus flowers) that adapts between mobile (portrait 3:4) and desktop (landscape 4:3) layouts.
- **Framer Motion animations** — Snake entry animations, floating lily pad motion, and smooth transitions throughout.
- **Google Fonts** — Long Cang, a casual Chinese brush handwriting font, for a personal and culturally grounded feel.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier)

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shedding-island.git
cd shedding-island
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Fill in your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### 3. Set Up Database

Run the following in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Main table
CREATE TABLE snake_segments (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  drawing_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (char_length(message) <= 140),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  location TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (location IN ('island', 'gallery')),
  position_x FLOAT NOT NULL CHECK (position_x >= 0 AND position_x <= 1),
  position_y FLOAT NOT NULL CHECK (position_y >= 0 AND position_y <= 1)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_snake_segments_location ON snake_segments(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_snake_segments_created_at ON snake_segments(created_at);

ALTER TABLE snake_segments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "anon_select" ON snake_segments
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Rate limiting
CREATE TABLE rate_limits (
  ip_hash TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  request_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  window_start TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE rate_limits ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Reports
CREATE TABLE reports (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  snake_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES snake_segments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  message TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_reports_snake_id ON reports(snake_id);
ALTER TABLE reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 4. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Add environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
4. Deploy

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| No user accounts | Anonymity is core to the ritual — people share more honestly when they're not identified |
| Client-side fading | Avoids DB writes for visual state; `created_at` is the single source of truth |
| Supabase for rate limiting | Eliminated Redis dependency while keeping atomic per-IP tracking |
| In-process moderation | No external API costs or latency; `leo-profanity` + custom normalization catches most evasion |
| Service role key for writes | Tightest possible RLS — the anon key can only read, period |
| SHA-256 IP hashing | Privacy-first rate limiting — raw IPs are never stored |
